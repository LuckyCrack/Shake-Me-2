# Shake Me
This app plays a Gif and a Sound Clip which repeates itself until the
user stops shaking.
It was Inspired by [@Pijoules's](www.github.com/PiJoules) Shake Me app which  was initially 
made just for playing the [Batman on Drugs video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1dvSlvZLG8) 
when the user shook the phone. Features were added to the app to allow the user to play any gif or mp4 
they downloaded on their phone so it is no longer limited to just this gif and mp4.

# App Permission
The app is not asking for any permissions from the user.
It was made on newer android sdk.
